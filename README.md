# inf03-Jan-25-react-remake
Recreated a Polish INF.03 practical exam for computer science vocational students (11th grade) as a break from another project. Decided to remake it with React instead of Vanilla JS, to get better at the library. Focused on breaking the project up into components, and routing.
